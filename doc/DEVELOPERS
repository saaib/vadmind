1.- Introduction
----------------
The instructions contained herein are provided as a set of very simple steps 
to start the development of your own VAdmind Plugins.


2.- What are the VAdmind Plugins?
---------------------------------
What I call 'plugins' are individual Perl modules which provide specific
functionality made available through the execution of several tasks (sub's)
related to the area of focus/interest of the module.

Those plugins will be dynamically loaded by the VAdmind server and then some of
the included subroutines will be executed. Both, module and task are specified
in the XML string sent by the client to the server.


3.- OK, but what about all of us first timers to VAdmin Plugins?
----------------------------------------------------------------
I'll explain how to develop plugins for the VAdmind server.
Before anything I should state that you'll need some previous knowledge in
order to code a VAdmind Plugin: Perl OO programming :)

The VAdmind project provides an easy and powerful platform in order to allow
interested developers to build new plugins. The VAdmind server handles the XML
requests received, then, for each individual task it takes the child 
elements values and stores the data in a hash array called '{in}'. Through that
hash array, the developer can access all those values anywere needed in the
plugin code.

VAdmind provides as well another structure which should be used by the
developer to store information that will be sent back (server->client). This
information is:

    - error message,
    - return code,
    - an alternative xml string to return

Please read the QUERIES document for a reference of the DTD for the XML string.


4.- It seems relative easy... Do i need to include any specific code?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Yes, each VAdmind plugin should have the following code inserted at the
beginning of the file:


package PluginName;
use strict;

sub new {
    my $type = shift;
    my $self = {@_};
    return bless ($self, $type);
}


Of course, you should replace "PluginName" with your plugin name.

IMPORTANT:
   Note that the name defined here should match the filename inside the VAdmind
   plugin/ folder.

Also, for every subroutine that will be executed by the VAdmind server, the
following lines should be added:


sub TaskName {
   my $sefl = shift;
   my $info = $self->{in};
   ...

}


5- I Have my VAdmidn Plugin ready, now what?
--------------------------------------------
If you followed the VAdmind Plugin Development recommendations then
your plugin is already in place to be used, and you should do nothing further,
unless of course you need to extend the functionality of the plugin.

If you developed a VAdmind Plugin and now want to test/implement it, you'll
only need to place the it inside the VAdmind/Plugins directory, connect to
the VAdmind server and send the propper XML strings.


6- I'm running VAdmind on SSL mode, how to debug?
-------------------------------------------------
You can connect manually to your server using the following command:

openssl s_client -connect localhost:1590

Make sure you change 'localhost' and '1590' for your daemon server ip and port.
