Here we go !

OK, we asume you have installed and tested the following pre-requisites:

- An installed Linux/*NIX like system.
- Perl 5 (VAdmind was developed using v5.8.0)
- The following perl modules installed on your system:
  XML::Simple perl and IO::Socket::SSL
- The xinetd package installed in your system (optional).

Once we have satisfied the previous requisites, the instructions to setup this
Virtual Administrator Daemon (VAdmind) are a few and very simple:

1. As root, run the setup tool and provide requested information:

	# setup.pl


	This will configure vadmind.xml with the correct md5_hex key. The default values
	are user: vadmind and host: localhost.
	
	The following lines will be appended to /etc/services:

	vadmind         1888/tcp                    # Virtual Administrator Daemon

	As you can see, the default port is 1888.

	A copy of the doc/xinetd.conf will be transfered to /etc/xinetd.d/vadmind
	in order to enable the service on xinetd. Here's the content of the file:

	service vadmind
	{
		socket_type = stream
		protocol = tcp
		user = root
		server = <_PATH_TO_VADMIND_>/vadmind.pl
		server_args = <_PATH_TO_VADMIND_>/vadmind.xml
		wait = no
	}
	
	<_PATH_TO_VADMIND_> will be replaced with the installation directory you 
	specify when running the tool.

6. If you'll execute vadmind.pl using xinetd, make sure to edit the vadmind.xml 
   config file and change the <mode>daemon</mode> to something different.

6.1 Restart you xinetd/inetd daemon and that's it !

7. If you'll execute vadmind.pl as a standalone daemon, make sure to edit the
   vadmind.xml config file and change the <mode></mode> to daemon. ie:

   <mode>daemon</mode>



If you have any comments, suggestions, want to help debugging, commenting,
sending any kind of improvements that the code might have... 

What are you waiting for??  :)
