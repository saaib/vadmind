Virtual Administrator Daemon v0.4.0
Copyright (c) Urivan Saaib <urivan (at) saaib.net>
All rights reserved.

VAdmind is intended to provide the server management through a set of XML strings
which you can use to send one or more commands to execute at once in the remote
server. This project has in mind those server admins which have the need to manage
several servers, or that want to send the same command to several servers at once,
the architecture of the server has been designed to be as flexible as possible,
so the client side can do whatever they want.

The distribution of this software is simple, when you untared the file a
directory "VAdmind" was created, inside that directory is the following :

- bin/vadmind.pl         The vadmind daemon.
- bin/setup.pl           Setup tool. Run only once.
- conf/vadmind.xml       Configuration file.
- log/vadmind.log        Default Log file.
- lib/VAdmind.pm         Main VAdmind module.
- doc/                   The directory where you found this file ! :)
- doc/README             Guess what ??? this file !
- doc/AUTHORS            The list of contributors to this project.
- doc/ChangeLog          Some comments on what and when was added.
- doc/COPYING            The GPL license
- doc/INSTALL            Instructions on how to setup vadmind.
- doc/QUERIES            Definition of the XML protocol being used by the
                         daemon. Strings expected and returned.
- doc/xinetd.conf        An example on how to configure xinetd on your
  			 server.
- lib/VAdmind/Plugins/   Directory where to place all the vadmind plugins.
                         As this project evolves, more plugins will be developed
                         and included in the default distribution.
- certs/                 Default certificates when run as SSL daemon.


For those who are new to this piece of software, this project started as a remote
server management system specialized for Virtual Servers back in 1995. Many of you
will say, well there are already several tools for remote server management !, yes,
there are some, but none of them achieved what i needed in functionality, nor had 
the right license.

If you have any comments, suggestions, or want to contribute to the development
of this software in any way, please contact me (see below).
